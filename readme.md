# Deep Learning and Practice

## Lab1

Parcticing Backward propagation.


## Lab2

Contruct EEGNet and DeepConvNet to classify EEG signal.

## Lab3
Design a Network to classify diabetic retinopathy level.

## Lab4
Implement a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for video prediction.

## Lab5
Implement a conditional GAN and generate synthetic images based on multi-labels conditions.

## Lab6
learn and implement two deep reinforcement algorithms

## Final:

**Implement Multi-Scale group on Deep Hierarchical VAE
& Analyze different architecture**

By reading the paper [<NVAE: A Deep Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03898),
we start to implement the NVAE structure.
